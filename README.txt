	Pretty much finished, just need to figure out meta tags stuff

May 28th:
	-I think the reason forms aren't working on domain is because I have yet 	to connect my domain to a database. Need to connect to MySQL database
	-Yay! Fixed problem of submissions not being sent to mysql!
	-Changed db login info and forms still not working on domain :(
	-Will now try to add visitor count using php instead of other thing
